Integration of the Drag Ruler module (https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-drag-ruler) for Dungeons and Dragons 5e with support for flight.

Now has TokenHUD option to select movement type, currently TokenHUD UI selction does not persist when selecting token but option is saved.

Currently does not distingush between difficult terrain while flying if using Enhanced Terrain Later (https://github.com/ironmonk88/enhanced-terrain-layer)
